# Welcome to my repository documenting my assignment work during the 'From NAND to Tetris' course.

### This is one of the best courses on Computer Architecture, offered online by The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It's website can be found here, and it can be found on Coursera here.

This course uses it's own custom HDL which I learnt in order to write code for the project-centered assignments in this couse, by the end of which I successfully coded a simple but effective and turing-complete microprocessor.
